# Sum square difference
## Problem 6 
The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

<div style="text-align:center">12 + 22 + ... + 102 = 385</div>

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

<div style="text-align:center">(1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 552 = 3025</div>

Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
